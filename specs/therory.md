Great question. Here’s a clean, league-size-agnostic way to formalize the problem and then turn your Monte Carlo survival estimates + positional drop-offs into an optimal (or near-optimal) picking policy.

---

# 1) Notation

* Teams in league: $N$ (arbitrary).
* Your slot: $s \in \{1,\dots,N\}$.
* Your pick times (overall pick numbers): for round $r=1,2,\dots$

  $$
  \text{overall}(r,s)=
  \begin{cases}
  (r-1)N+s, & r\ \text{odd}\\[2pt]
  rN-s+1, & r\ \text{even}
  \end{cases}
  $$

  Let the sequence of your own picks be $t_1<t_2<\dots<t_m$ (enough to fill starters).
* Positions $p\in\{\text{QB},\text{RB},\text{WR},\text{TE}\}$ with required counts $q_{\text{QB}}=1, q_{\text{RB}}=3, q_{\text{WR}}=2, q_{\text{TE}}=1$.
* Players $i=1,\dots,M$ with:

  * projected season points $v_i>0$ (from `rankings_top300`)
  * position $p(i)$
* From Monte Carlo, estimate survival probabilities:

  $$
  s_{i}(t_k)=\Pr\{\text{player } i \text{ is available at your pick } t_k\}.
  $$

# 2) Deterministic benchmark (if future is known)

If you *knew* exactly who survives to each $t_k$, the optimal draft is a 0-1 assignment:

$$
\max \sum_{i,k} v_i x_{i,k}
$$

subject to

$$
\sum_{i} x_{i,k}\le 1 \quad(\text{one player per pick}),
$$

$$
\sum_{k} x_{i,k}\le 1 \quad(\text{pick a player at most once}),
$$

$$
\sum_{i: p(i)=p}\sum_k x_{i,k} = q_p \quad(\text{fill each position quota}),
$$

$$
x_{i,k}\le a_{i,k}\in\{0,1\} \quad(\text{availability indicator at } t_k),
$$

$$
x_{i,k}\in\{0,1\}.
$$

This is a maximum-weight b-matching with precedence/availability and gives the true optimum. It’s the gold standard your stochastic methods should approximate.

---

# 3) Stochastic dynamic program (exact but intractable)

When availability is uncertain, the adaptive optimum is:

* State at your $k$-th pick: $\big(k,\; \mathbf{q}\big)$, with remaining slot counts $\mathbf{q}=(q_{\text{QB}},q_{\text{RB}},q_{\text{WR}},q_{\text{TE}})$.
* Action: choose any available $i$ with $q_{p(i)}>0$.
* Reward: $v_i$.
* Transition: $\mathbf{q}\mapsto \mathbf{q}-\mathbf{e}_{p(i)}$; future availability random.

Bellman equation:

$$
V^\*(k,\mathbf{q})=\mathbb{E}\left[\max_{i\in \mathcal{A}_{k}}\left\{v_i+V^\*(k+1,\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{e}_{p(i)})\right\}\right],
$$

where $\mathcal{A}_{k}$ is the random set available at $t_k$.

This is the “correct” formulation but is exponential to solve exactly. So we use principled approximations that leverage your Monte Carlo $s_i(t_k)$.

---

# 4) Ladder EV for a position at a future pick (uses your survival probs)

For each position $p$, sort its players by projection: $i_1,i_2,\dots$ with $v_{i_1}\ge v_{i_2}\ge\dots$.

**Expected best available at time $t$:**

$$
E[V_{p}(t)] \;\approx\; \sum_{j\ge1} v_{i_j}\, s_{i_j}(t)\,\prod_{h<j}\big(1-s_{i_h}(t)\big).
$$

Interpretation: player $i_j$ contributes iff he survives and everyone ranked above him in that position does **not** survive. (This independence assumption is the standard, tractable approximation; your Monte Carlo can also estimate these “top-of-ladder” probabilities directly if you track joint events.)

This single formula fuses **survival** and **positional drop-off** into a clean EV for “filling position $p$ at pick $t$”.

---

# 5) One-step “delta” that decides which position to take **now**

At your current pick $t_k$, for each position $p$ with $q_p>0$, compare filling it **now** vs **at your next chance for that position** (call it $t_k^{(p,\text{next})}$; it’s the next $t_\ell$ where you might still need $p$):

$$
\Delta_p(k) \;:=\; \underbrace{E[V_{p}(t_k)]}_{\text{take }p\text{ now}}\;-\;\underbrace{E[V_{p}\big(t_k^{(p,\text{next})}\big)]}_{\text{delay }p}.
$$

**Policy (myopic but strong):**
Pick the position $p^\*=\arg\max_p \Delta_p(k)$.
Then, within that position, take the highest-$v_i$ currently available.

This chooses the position with the largest **expected loss from waiting** (the steepest drop-off under your survival landscape). It is precisely the “positional delta” you described, made explicit.

> Multi-round deltas: If you want more lookahead, compute
> $\Delta_p(k\!\to\!k+r)=E[V_p(t_k)]-E[V_p(t_{k+r})]$ for the next $r$ windows, or even a two-position comparison
> $\Delta_p(k)+\Delta_{p'}(k\!+\!1)$ to capture local interactions.

---

# 6) Multi-slot positions (RB×3, WR×2)

You need multiple slots for RB/WR. Generalize by assigning **times to slots**.

* Let $\mathcal{T}_k=\{t_k,\dots,t_m\}$ be your remaining picks.
* For each remaining slot $u$ (e.g., RB$_1$, RB$_2$, …), define a *disjoint* ladder by progressively removing the top names you already plan to use in earlier slots of the same position. Then compute a cell weight:

  $$
  w_{u,t}=E[V_{p(u)}^{(u)}(t)]
  $$

  where $E[V^{(u)}]$ is the ladder EV after removing the $u-1$ earlier planned names for that position.

**Assignment step:** choose a one-to-one mapping of remaining slots $\{u\}$ to times $\{t\in\mathcal{T}_k\}$ maximizing $\sum w_{u,t}$. That’s a standard weighted bipartite matching (Hungarian algorithm). It gives you *which pick* to devote to *which position/slot*. At runtime, you draft the best currently available name from that slot’s ladder.

This retains global coordination across RB×3 / WR×2 while still using your survival-aware EVs.

---

# 7) Player-level “opportunity-adjusted value” (OAV)

Sometimes you want a **single score per player** at the current pick to compare across positions:

Let $t'=t_k^{(p(i),\text{next})}$ (your next chance to fill that position). Define the *expected replacement value* if you skip now and fill later as the ladder EV for that position at $t'$:

$$
R_{p(i)}(t') := E[V_{p(i)}(t')].
$$

Then the **opportunity-adjusted value** for taking player $i$ *now* is

$$
\text{OAV}_i(t_k) = v_i \;-\; R_{p(i)}(t').
$$

Pick the player with the largest $\text{OAV}_i(t_k)$.
(You can extend to a two-step OAV by comparing $t',t''$ for later slots of the same position.)

---

# 8) LP “planner” that pre-allocates picks (fast, global, solvable)

As a fast global plan (to be re-solved each pick), use the expected-value relaxation:

Decision variables $y_{i,k}\in[0,1]$ meaning “probability/weight we intend to take player $i$ at pick $t_k$”.

$$
\max \sum_{i,k} v_i\, s_i(t_k)\, y_{i,k}
$$

subject to

$$
\sum_{i} y_{i,k}\le 1 \quad (\text{one pick per time}),\qquad
\sum_{k} y_{i,k}\le 1 \quad (\text{don’t double-pick a player}),
$$

$$
\sum_{i: p(i)=p}\sum_k y_{i,k} = q_p \quad (\text{fill quotas}),
\quad 0\le y_{i,k}\le 1.
$$

Solve once, draft the highest-weight feasible choice at runtime, then **recompute** with updated $s_i$ after each real pick. This is a standard two-stage stochastic approximation; it’s not the full DP but performs very well with good survival estimates.

---

# 9) What your Monte Carlo must produce

From your simulations (non-deterministic opponent behavior), compute:

* $s_i(t_k)=\Pr\{i\text{ survives to } t_k\}$ for all $i,k$.
* (Optional, stronger) joint events among top few names per position to relax the independence assumption in the ladder EV formula. If you have joint survival for the top $L$ per position, replace the product with exact inclusion using those joints.

---

# 10) Practical recipe at the table

1. Precompute $s_i(t_k)$ from Monte Carlo; sort ladders by $v_i$.
2. At pick $t_k$:

   * Compute $E[V_p(t_k)]$ and $E[V_p(t_k^{(p,\text{next})})]$ for all needed $p$.
   * Compute $\Delta_p(k)=E[V_p(t_k)]-E[V_p(t_k^{(p,\text{next})})]$.
   * **Pick the position** with largest $\Delta_p(k)$.
   * Within that position, pick the highest $v_i$ currently on the board (or use $\text{OAV}_i$ if you want player-level scoring).
   * Remove the chosen player; update remaining slot counts; **recompute** $s_i$ if you’re updating the MC online, else reuse.
   * (Optional) every pick, re-solve the LP planner or the assignment step in §6 to keep a global plan.

This policy is fast, survival-aware, and mathematically grounded. In the limit of perfect survival modeling and frequent recomputation, it converges toward the DP optimum while being simple enough to run live.

## TL;DR: The key formulas

* **Survival from Monte Carlo:**
  $\displaystyle s_i(t_k)=\frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^B \mathbf{1}\{\text{sim }b \text{ leaves } i \text{ until } t_k\}$.

* **Expected best available for a position at pick $t$:**
  $\displaystyle E[V_{p}(t)] \approx \sum_{j\ge1} v_{i_j}\, s_{i_j}(t)\,\prod_{h<j}\big(1-s_{i_h}(t)\big).$

* **Positional delta (now vs next):**
  $\displaystyle \Delta_p(k)=E[V_p(t_k)]-E[V_p(t_k^{(p,\text{next})})].$

* **Player-level opportunity-adjusted value:**
  $\displaystyle \text{OAV}_i(t_k)=v_i - E[V_{p(i)}(t_k^{(p(i),\text{next})})].$

* **Global LP planner (re-solve each pick):**
  $\displaystyle \max \sum_{i,k} v_i s_i(t_k) y_{i,k}$ with the assignment & quota constraints above.

Use these and you’ll always be drafting the seven players that (in expectation under your Monte Carlo) maximize your starting total.
