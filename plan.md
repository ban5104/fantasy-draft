# üéØ Minimal MVP: DP-Based Draft Optimizer with Survival Probabilities

### **Step 1. Data ingest**

* Load `espn_projections_20250814.csv` (gives draft order baseline).
* Load `rankings_top300_20250814.csv` (gives projected season fantasy points).
* Normalize names ‚Üí join by `(name, team)` to get `player_id, position, projection`.

**Libraries to use:**
- **pandas** for CSV loading and joins
- **RapidFuzz** for fuzzy name matching/normalization between datasets

### **Step 2. Monte Carlo survival estimates**

* Simulate the draft board **B times** (10 for dev, 1000 for production):

  * Other teams pick stochastically, e.g. weighted by ESPN rank ¬± noise.
  * Track whether player $i$ survives to each of your picks $t_k$.
* Estimate:

  $$
  s_i(t_k) = \frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^B \mathbf{1}\{i \text{ survives to } t_k\}
  $$

Store as a dict: `{(player_id, pick_number): survival_prob}`.

**Libraries to use:**
- **NumPy** for random generation and array operations
- **SciPy stats** for probability distributions (beta/normal for opponent behavior modeling)

### **Step 3. Ladder EVs per position**

For each position $p$, at each pick $t_k$, for slot $u$ (the u-th player at that position):

```python
def compute_ladder_ev(position_players, pick, slot, survival_probs):
    # Skip first (slot-1) players for slot u
    eligible = position_players[slot-1:]
    
    ev = 0.0
    prob_all_gone = 1.0
    
    for player in eligible:
        s = survival_probs.get((player['id'], pick), 0)
        ev += player['fantasy_pts'] * s * prob_all_gone
        prob_all_gone *= (1 - s)
    
    return ev
```

This gives $E[V_p^{(u)}(t_k)]$, the expected value of the u-th best available player at position $p$ at pick $t_k$.

**Libraries to use:**
- **pandas groupby** for position-based aggregations
- **NumPy** for vectorized probability calculations

### **Step 4. Dynamic Programming over Positions**

Key insight: With only 48 reachable states (position counts) √ó 7 picks = 336 total states, we can solve globally optimal strategy:

**State representation**: `(k, rb_count, wr_count, qb_count, te_count)` where:
- k ‚àà [0,6] (pick index)  
- rb_count ‚àà [0,3], wr_count ‚àà [0,2], qb_count ‚àà [0,1], te_count ‚àà [0,1]

**DP recurrence**:
```python
F(k, r, w, q, t) = max over valid positions p {
    ladder_ev(p, pick_k, slot_u) + F(k+1, r', w', q', t')
}
```
where slot_u = current count of position p + 1

**Implementation**: Use backward induction from pick 7 to pick 1, with `@lru_cache` for memoization.

### **Step 5. Policy**

The DP solution gives us the globally optimal position to draft at each pick:
1. Run DP to build optimal value table
2. At draft time, extract optimal position from DP table given current state
3. Draft the best available player at that position

### **Step 6. Metrics**

* Print the drafted 7 starters + total projected points.
* Compare across seeds/MC runs to sanity-check stability.
* Log the $\Delta_p(k)$ values each pick to see if the math matches intuition.

# üîß Implementation Architecture (actual code structure)

```python
# dp_draft_optimizer.py (~200 lines total)

# Core DP solver with memoization
@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def dp_solve(k, rb_count, wr_count, qb_count, te_count):
    # Base case: all picks made
    if k >= len(MY_PICKS):
        if is_complete_roster(rb_count, wr_count, qb_count, te_count):
            return 0
        return -float('inf')
    
    best_value = -float('inf')
    
    # Try each position
    for position, (current, max_needed) in [
        ('RB', (rb_count, 3)),
        ('WR', (wr_count, 2)),
        ('QB', (qb_count, 1)),
        ('TE', (te_count, 1))
    ]:
        if current < max_needed:
            slot = current + 1
            ev = compute_ladder_ev(position, MY_PICKS[k], slot)
            future = dp_solve(k+1, *update_counts(position))
            best_value = max(best_value, ev + future)
    
    return best_value

# At draft time: extract optimal position
def get_optimal_position(k, rb, wr, qb, te):
    # Returns "RB", "WR", "QB", or "TE" based on DP solution
```

# ‚úÖ Why this is a good MVP

* **Globally optimal:** DP finds the mathematically optimal strategy (not just greedy).
* **Computationally tractable:** Only 48 states √ó 7 picks = 336 total states (runs in milliseconds).
* **Transparent math:** You can print the ladder EVs and DP values to understand decisions.
* **Validates theory:** Tests whether survival probabilities + DP actually improve draft outcomes.

## üîë Key Theoretical Insight

The breakthrough is using **DP-over-positions** instead of DP-over-players:
- **State space**: Only 48 possible roster configurations (QB/RB/WR/TE counts)
- **Action space**: Only 4 choices per pick (which position to draft)
- **Reward**: Survival-aware ladder EV for the next slot of that position
- **Result**: Globally optimal position sequence that maximizes expected total points

This avoids the exponential complexity of considering all possible player combinations while still finding the optimal strategy.

# üîç Relevant Open Source Repos to Study

## For Monte Carlo Draft Simulation
- **[joewlos/fantasy_football_monte_carlo_draft_simulator](https://github.com/joewlos/fantasy_football_monte_carlo_draft_simulator)**
  - Uses Monte Carlo to predict player availability (exactly what we need!)
  - Has survival probability implementation
  - Could adapt their opponent modeling approach

## For Draft Strategy Testing
- **[faverogian/nfl-fantasim](https://github.com/faverogian/nfl-fantasim)**
  - Tests different strategies (BPA, WR_HEAVY, RB_HEAVY, etc.)
  - Has simulation framework you could adapt
  - Good reference for structuring Monte Carlo runs

## Note: What's NOT Relevant
- **VOR/VBD repos**: Our MVP uses survival probabilities + EV ladders, NOT value over replacement
- **DFS optimizers**: Daily fantasy is different from season-long draft

## What to Actually Use vs Study
- **Study for patterns**: Monte Carlo structure, opponent modeling
- **Don't import directly**: These are full apps with different core algorithms
- **Your innovation**: The "delta between now vs next pick" with survival probabilities appears unique

## What we're NOT using (yet):
- **Visualization**: No Plotly/Streamlit - just print results
- **Optimization**: No Numba/Cython - pure Python is fast enough  
- **Infrastructure**: No Poetry/pytest/black - keep it simple
- **Orchestration**: No Prefect/Airflow - just run the script
- **Caching**: No joblib/diskcache - recompute is cheap
- **Advanced stats**: No ArviZ/uncertainty - point estimates only
