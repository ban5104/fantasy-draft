Perfect ‚Äî since you‚Äôre an engineer, you‚Äôll want a minimal loop you can actually run live with the CSVs you‚Äôve got. Here‚Äôs a lean MVP framework you can implement in <200 lines to test the math in practice.

# üéØ Minimal MVP: Survival-Aware Draft Optimizer

### **Step 1. Data ingest**

* Load `espn_projections_20250814.csv` (gives draft order baseline).
* Load `rankings_top300_20250814.csv` (gives projected season fantasy points).
* Normalize names ‚Üí join by `(name, team)` to get `player_id, position, projection`.

**Libraries to use:**
- **pandas** for CSV loading and joins
- **RapidFuzz** for fuzzy name matching/normalization between datasets

### **Step 2. Monte Carlo survival estimates**

* Simulate the draft board **B times** (e.g. 1,000):

  * Other teams pick stochastically, e.g. weighted by ESPN rank ¬± noise.
  * Track whether player $i$ survives to each of your picks $t_k$.
* Estimate:

  $$
  s_i(t_k) = \frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^B \mathbf{1}\{i \text{ survives to } t_k\}
  $$

Store as a `pandas.DataFrame` with columns: `player_id, pos, pick_number, survival_prob`.

**Libraries to use:**
- **NumPy** for random generation and array operations
- **SciPy stats** for probability distributions (beta/normal for opponent behavior modeling)

### **Step 3. Ladder EVs per position**

For each position $p$, at each pick $t_k$:

```python
def expected_value_ladder(players_p, survival_probs, t_k):
    # players_p: sorted list of players at position p by projection
    ev = 0
    prob_all_gone = 1.0
    for player in players_p:
        s = survival_probs[(player.id, t_k)]
        ev += player.pts * s * prob_all_gone
        prob_all_gone *= (1 - s)
    return ev
```

This gives $E[V_p(t_k)]$, the expected best available if you take position $p$ at $t_k$.

**Libraries to use:**
- **pandas groupby** for position-based aggregations
- **NumPy** for vectorized probability calculations

### **Step 4. Compute deltas**

At each pick $t_k$:

$$
\Delta_p(k) = E[V_p(t_k)] - E[V_p(t_{k}^{(p,\text{next})})]
$$

where $t_{k}^{(p,\text{next})}$ is your next pick where you might still need position $p$.

### **Step 5. Policy**

* Maintain counts of how many of each slot you still need (1 QB, 3 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE).
* At each pick:

  1. Compute $\Delta_p(k)$ for each needed position.
  2. Pick the position with max $\Delta_p(k)$.
  3. From current board, select the surviving player at that position with the highest projection.
* Update needs + board, repeat.

### **Step 6. Metrics**

* Print the drafted 7 starters + total projected points.
* Compare across seeds/MC runs to sanity-check stability.
* Log the $\Delta_p(k)$ values each pick to see if the math matches intuition.

# üîß Minimal Prototype Loop (pseudocode)

```python
needs = {"QB":1,"RB":3,"WR":2,"TE":1}
my_picks = [5, 24, 33, 52, 61, 80, 89]  # 14-team snake example

for k, pick_no in enumerate(my_picks):
    # 1. For each needed position compute EV now and EV at next
    deltas = {}
    for p in needs:
        if needs[p] > 0:
            ev_now  = expected_value_ladder(players[p], survival, pick_no)
            ev_next = expected_value_ladder(players[p], survival, next_pick_for(p, k))
            deltas[p] = ev_now - ev_next

    # 2. Choose best position
    chosen_pos = max(deltas, key=deltas.get)

    # 3. Pick top surviving player in that position
    chosen_player = top_available(chosen_pos, board, survival, pick_no)

    # 4. Update state
    draft(chosen_player)
    needs[chosen_pos] -= 1
```

# ‚úÖ Why this is a good MVP

* **Small surface area:** Only requires survival probs and projections (you already have both).
* **Transparent math:** You can print EV ladders and deltas to see the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù.
* **Extendable:** Once this skeleton runs, you can plug in:

  * different opponent models in Monte Carlo
  * Hungarian assignment (¬ß6 in my earlier answer) to coordinate RB√ó3/WR√ó2
  * LP planner for global optimization.

Would you like me to **write you an actual working Python module** (consuming your two CSVs and producing an example draft plan with deltas logged each pick) so you can run it end-to-end?

# üì¶ Minimal Dependencies

```txt
# requirements.txt
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0

That's it! Just 4 dependencies for the entire MVP.

# üîç Relevant Open Source Repos to Study

## For Monte Carlo Draft Simulation
- **[joewlos/fantasy_football_monte_carlo_draft_simulator](https://github.com/joewlos/fantasy_football_monte_carlo_draft_simulator)**
  - Uses Monte Carlo to predict player availability (exactly what we need!)
  - Has survival probability implementation
  - Could adapt their opponent modeling approach

## For Draft Strategy Testing
- **[faverogian/nfl-fantasim](https://github.com/faverogian/nfl-fantasim)**
  - Tests different strategies (BPA, WR_HEAVY, RB_HEAVY, etc.)
  - Has simulation framework you could adapt
  - Good reference for structuring Monte Carlo runs

## Note: What's NOT Relevant
- **VOR/VBD repos**: Our MVP uses survival probabilities + EV ladders, NOT value over replacement
- **DFS optimizers**: Daily fantasy is different from season-long draft

## What to Actually Use vs Study
- **Study for patterns**: Monte Carlo structure, opponent modeling
- **Don't import directly**: These are full apps with different core algorithms
- **Your innovation**: The "delta between now vs next pick" with survival probabilities appears unique

## What we're NOT using (yet):
- **Visualization**: No Plotly/Streamlit - just print results
- **Optimization**: No Numba/Cython - pure Python is fast enough  
- **Infrastructure**: No Poetry/pytest/black - keep it simple
- **Orchestration**: No Prefect/Airflow - just run the script
- **Caching**: No joblib/diskcache - recompute is cheap
- **Advanced stats**: No ArviZ/uncertainty - point estimates only
